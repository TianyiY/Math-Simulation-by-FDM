# Math-Simulation-of-Reservoir
Math simulation of formation fluid by finite difference method

Numerically simulating single phase slightly compressible fluids in an
oil reservoir. Finite difference method is used for simulation. 
Targeting at predicting the fluid flow rate and formation pressure distribution
